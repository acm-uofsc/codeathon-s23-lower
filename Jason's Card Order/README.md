# <Problem Name>

## Problem Statement

Jason has been building decklists for EDH. However, to buy all at once he needs to eleminate duplicate cards from his mass entry order.
Given a list of cards return the name of the duplicate card.

## Input Format

You will be given a positive int number followed by that number of words as a String through the console.
ex:
10
Command Tower
Plains
War Room
Evolving Wilds
Swamp
Badlands
Forest
Island
Exotic Orchard
Command Tower

## Constraints

The number at the beginning will be between 10 and 20 inclusive. There will always only be one duplicate word in a given problem.

## Output Format

Command Tower

# Instructions for Problem Writers

Replace all filler with your own information. This is what will go in HackerRank.

Modify mkin.py to print the problem input to the console.

Run genSamples.sh to only generate the inputs for the sample cases. You may want special checks on test number if you want to generate a certain number of very large tests. 

Run runSampleInput.sh to generate sample outputs using your **correct** solution (solutions/sol.py). Make sure these are valid.

Run testgen.sh to generate the remaining test cases. Modify this if you need more/fewer test cases. The cases.zip file is what will be uploaded to HackerRank.
