# Pwned Password Protection Program

## Problem Statement

In a collaboration between FinalPass, a password manager, and AmIPwned.com, a website to check if your usernames and passwords have been leaked, you have been contracted to create a tool to check if a users' passwords have been pwned! (leaked)

Given the sensitive nature of passwords, FinalPass will only give you a shuffled version of each users' passwords. You need to ensure that the combination of letters, numbers, and symbols do not appear in the database of pwned passwords provided by AmIPwned.com

Since you aren't checking if the exact password appears in the database, you are instead checking if the same number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols appear in the database **in any order**.

## Input Format

What does each line contain? What data type(s)?

## Constraints

What are the constraints on the number of lines, size of each parameter, etc.

## Output Format

What should the output look like? What data type(s)?

# Instructions for Problem Writers

Replace all filler with your own information. This is what will go in HackerRank.

Modify mkin.py to print the problem input to the console.

Run genSamples.sh to only generate the inputs for the sample cases. You may want special checks on test number if you want to generate a certain number of very large tests. 

Run runSampleInput.sh to generate sample outputs using your **correct** solution (solutions/sol.py). Make sure these are valid.

Run testgen.sh to generate the remaining test cases. Modify this if you need more/fewer test cases. The cases.zip file is what will be uploaded to HackerRank.
